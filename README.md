# Lazypig 2.4.3

LazyPig is originally a vanilla World of Warcraft(Ver 1.12) addon created by ogrisch for Feenix private server. Later Flierr ported it to The Burning Crusade expansion(Ver 2.4.3). It is my favorite vanilla addon and features series of small quality of life improvements. 

Github repo links for those projects are listed below(Not sure whether stan666 is ogrisch or not)
lazypig vanilla: https://github.com/satan666/_LP
lazypig TBC: https://github.com/Flierr/LazypigTBC

However Flierr's TBC ported version comes with many errors and broken functions. As feenix server has been dead for a while and the above repos were no longer active, I feel like I have the responsibility to carrying over their great work. All credit goes to ogrisch and Flierr.
